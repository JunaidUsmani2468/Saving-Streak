/*
DAY 32 PROBLEM: COUNT VALID SCORES (ARRAY + OBJECT)
--------------------------------------------------

You are given:
1. An array of numbers representing scores
2. An object that defines valid score rules

const scores = [10, 20, 15, 30, 25, 10, 40];
const rules = {
  min: 15,
  max: 30
};

TASK:
1. Count how many scores are VALID
2. A score is valid if:
   - score >= rules.min
   - score <= rules.max
3. Store the result in a variable called `count`
4. Log the result

RULES:
- Do NOT use built-in helpers (filter, map, reduce)
- Use only loops and conditions
- Traverse the array only once

Expected Output:
4

Explanation:
Valid scores are: 20, 15, 30, 25
