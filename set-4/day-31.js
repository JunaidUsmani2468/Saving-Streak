DAY 31 PROBLEM: COUNT WORDS BY LENGTH LIST
----------------------------------

Given an array of numbers and a string:

*/

const lengths = [3, 4, 5];
const text = "code daily build logic with focus";

/*
TASK:
1. Count how many WORDS in the string have a length
   that exists in the `lengths` array
2. Words are separated by single spaces
3. Comparison is case-sensitive
4. Store the result in a variable called `count`
5. Log the result

RULES:
1. Do NOT use built-in helpers (split, includes, map, filter, reduce)
2. Use only loops and conditions
3. Handle the first and last word correctly

Expected Output:
4

Explanation:
Words with valid lengths:
code (4), daily (5), build (5), logic (5)
