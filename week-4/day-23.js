DAY 23 PROBLEM: LONGEST INCREASING STREAK
----------------------------------

Given an array of numbers:

*/
const nums = [2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 0, 2, 3, 4];

/*
TASK:
1. Find the length of the LONGEST CONTIGUOUS increasing subarray
2. Increasing means: nums[i] > nums[i - 1]
3. The streak breaks as soon as the order fails
4. Store the result in a variable called `maxStreak`
5. Log the result

RULES:
1. Do NOT use built-in helpers (map, filter, reduce, Math.max)
2. Use only loops and conditions
3. Handle resets correctly

Expected Output:
4

Explanation:
Longest increasing streak is:
[1, 4, 6, 7] → length = 4
